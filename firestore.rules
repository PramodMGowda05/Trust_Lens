/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for TrustView Application
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset enforces a strict user-ownership model for user profiles and their associated reviews.
 * Only authenticated users can access their own data, and administrators have elevated privileges.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /users/{userId}: Stores user profile information, accessible only by the user and admins.
 * - /users/{userId}/reviews/{reviewId}: Stores reviews submitted by each user, accessible only by the user and admins.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}:  Presence of a document grants the user admin privileges.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Users can only access their own user document and associated reviews.
 * - Listing of all users is disallowed for privacy.
 * - Admin privileges are granted based on the existence of a document in the `/roles_admin/{userId}` collection.
 * - Data validation is minimized to facilitate rapid prototyping, focusing primarily on ownership and relational integrity.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 *  - User ownership is enforced through path-based rules, eliminating the need for `get()` calls to determine ownership.
